    <h1>The fundamentals of understanding color theory</h1>
    <p>
        Color theory is both the science and art of using color. It explains how humans perceive color; and the visual
        effects of how colors mix, match or contrast with each other. Color theory also involves the messages colors
        communicate; and the methods used to replicate color.
        In color theory, colors are organized on a color wheel and grouped into 3 categories: primary colors, secondary
        colors and tertiary colors. More on that later.
        So why should you care about color theory as an entrepreneur? Why can't you just slap some red on your packaging
        and be done with it? It worked for Coke, right?
        Color theory will help you build your brand. And that will help you get more sales. Let's see how it all works.

    <h2>Understanding color</h2>
    <p>
        Color is perception. Our eyes see something (the sky, for example), and data sent from our eyes to our brains
        tells us it's a certain color (blue). Objects reflect light in different combinations of wavelengths. Our brains
        pick up on those wavelength combinations and translate them into the phenomenon we call color.
        When you're strolling down the soft drink aisle scanning the shelves filled with 82 million cans and bottles and
        trying to find your six-pack of Coke, what do you look for? The scripted logo or that familiar red can?
        People decide whether or not they like a product in 90 seconds or less. 90% of that decision is based solely on
        color. So, a very important part of your branding must focus on color.

    <h2>RGB: the additive color mixing model</h2>
    <p>
        Humans see colors in light waves. Mixing light—or the additive color mixing model—allows you to create colors by
        mixing red, green and blue light sources of various intensities. The more light you add, the brighter the color
        mix becomes. If you mix all three colors of light, you get pure, white light.
        TVs, screens and projectors use red, green and blue (RGB) as their primary colors, and then mix them together to
        create other colors.
